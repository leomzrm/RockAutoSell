# RockAutoSell
Auto-Sell System with GUI and Toggleable Items.
RockAutoSell is a lightweight, optimized, and user-friendly plugin that allows players to toggle automatic selling of specific items using a customizable GUI.

# Compatible Versions
- 1.18.x
- 1.19.x
- 1.20.x
- 1.21.x

# Main Features
- Easy-to-use GUI – Players can enable or disable AutoSell per item using a simple interface;
- Items Configuration – Add custom sellable items with specific prices and materials;
- Notifications - Players receive a notification of the latest sales;
- Customizable – Change the system however you like, including cooldowns, notifications, and more.;
- Language Support – Fully translatable messages;
- Permissions – Control access to multipliers, commands and features.

# Cases
RockAutoSell fits any type of server where auto-selling is useful, including:
- Prison – Automatically sell mined ores and blocks;
- Survival – Auto-sell farmed crops or mob drops;
- SkyBlock – Automate income sources;
- RankUp – Combine with economy and progress systems.

# How it Works?
When a player breaks a block, the plugin checks if any item in their inventory can be sold. If so, it's instantly sold and money is given. A cooldown (customizable) prevents it from happening too quickly.
